//Calculate the amount of change in dollars, quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies owe to a customer who purchases an item. Ask them how much money he item costs and how much theyâ€™re spending.
// set the "formula": pay-cost= change
separate the result in: dollars/ quarters/ dimes/ nickles/ pennies
1 dollar = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 20 nickles = 100 pennies
Ask the costumer how much the product cost; how much he is spenting.
tell the result
